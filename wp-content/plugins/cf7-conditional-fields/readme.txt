Adds conditional logic to Contact Form 7.

== Description ==

This plugin adds conditional logic to [Contact Form 7](https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7/).

If you edit your CF7 form, you will see an additional tag called "Conditional fields Group". Everything you put between the start and end tag will be hidden by default.
After you added the field group(s), you should click Save.
Then you should go to the "Conditional fields" tab to create one or more conditions that will make the group(s) appear.

= How to use it =

A detailed example of how to use the plugin can be found here: [http://bdwm.be/wpcf7cf/how-to-set-up-conditional-fields-for-contact-form-7/](http://bdwm.be/wpcf7cf/how-to-set-up-conditional-fields-for-contact-form-7/)

== Main/ New features ==

= Compatible with Contact Form 7 Multi-Step Forms =

Conditional Fields for Contact Form 7 is now fully compatible with <a target="_blank" href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7-multi-step-module/">Contact Form 7 Multi-Step Forms</a>

= Support for required fields =

Required fields can be used inside hidden groups without causing validation problems.

= Hide/show info in emails based on what groups are visible =

Conditional groups can now be added to the emails as well.
Just wrap the content with `[group-name] ... [/group-name]` tags.

= Groups can be nested =
Groups can be nested, both in the form and in the email

Example form:
`
[group group-1]
  [group group-inside-1]
    ...
  [/group]
[/group]`

Example email:
`
[group-1]
  [group-inside-1]
    ...
  [/group-inside-1]
[/group-1]`

= Advanced =

Advanced users can now code up the conditions as plain text instead of using the select boxes, using the import/export feature.

== Installation ==

Please follow the [standard installation procedure for WordPress plugins](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Installing_Plugins).

Follow [this tutorial](http://bdwm.be/wpcf7cf/how-to-set-up-conditional-fields-for-contact-form-7/) if you are not sure how to use the plugin.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Email message is not showing the correct values =

<strong>All field names should be unique</strong>

Even though your fields might never show up at the same time, it is still important to realize that WPCF7CF will not remove the fields, it merely hides them. So all fields will be submitted when the form is sent. Because of this no two fields can have the same name.

Incorrect form (2 input elements having the same name "a"):
`
[group group-1][select a "1" "2" "3"][/group]
[group group-2][select a "1" "2" "3"][/group]
`

Correct form (all groups and fields have unique names):
`
[group group-1][select a "1" "2" "3"][/group]
[group group-2][select b "1" "2" "3"][/group]
`

= All my groups show up all the time and never get hidden. =

<strong>Reason #1: Javascript error</strong>
Check your browser console (F12) for any javascript errors. WPCF7CF loads it's scripts at the bottom of the HTML page, so if some javascript error gets triggered before that, the code will not be executed in most browsers.
Before reaching out to the support forum try to determine which plugin or theme is causing the problem, by gradually disabling plugins and changing theme.

<strong>Reason #2: wp_footer() isn't loaded</strong>
Check if your theme is calling the `wp_footer()` function. Typically this function will be called in your theme's footer.php file.
The conditional fields javascript code is loaded during wp_footer, so a call to this function is crucial. If there is no such call in your theme, go to your theme's footer.php file and add this code right before the closing `</body>` tag:
`&lt;?php wp_footer(); ?&gt;`

= How do i show fields based on multiple conditions? (AND, OR, NAND, NOR) =

<strong>if a=1 AND b=2 then, show [group x]</strong>

You will need to create nested groups for the number of conditions, so your form might look like this:

`[select a "1" "2" "3"]
[select b "1" "2" "3"]
[group x-1][group x-2]TADA![/group][/group]`

and use these conditions

`if [a] equals "1" then show [x-1]
if [b] equals "2" then show [x-2]`

<strong>if a=1 OR b=2 then, show [group x]</strong>

This is more straightforward, as OR conditions are assumed. Giving this form:

`[select a "1" "2" "3"]
[select b "1" "2" "3"]
[group x]TADA![/group]`

You can simply use these conditions:

`if [a] equals "1" then show [x]
if [b] equals "2" then show [x]`

<strong>if a=1 NAND b=2 then, show [group x]</strong>

Same form as OR, but just use "not equals" instead of "equals":

`if [a] not equals "1" then show [x]
if [b] not equals "2" then show [x]`

<strong>if a=1 NOR b=2 then, show [group x]</strong>

Same form as AND, but just use "not equals" instead of "equals":

`if [a] not equals "1" then show [x-1]
if [b] not equals "2" then show [x-2]`

== Changelog ==

= 1.3.4 =
* small fix (https://wordpress.org/support/topic/wpcf7_contactform-object-is-no-longer-accessible/)

= 1.3.3 =
* Changes tested with WP 4.7.5 and CF7 4.8
* Changed the inner mechanics a bit to make the plugin more edge-case proof and prepare for future ajax support
* Fix problems introduced by CF7 4.8 update
* Because the CF7 author, Takayuki Miyoshi, decided to get rid of the 'form-pre-serialize' javascript event, the hidden fields containing data about which groups are shown/hidden will now be updated when the form is loaded and each time a form value changes. This might make the plugin slightly slower, but it is the only solution I found so far.
* Small bug fix (https://wordpress.org/support/topic/php-depreciated-warning/#post-9151404)

= 0.2.7 =
* Added support for conditional fields in the email (2) field

* Removed anonymous functions from code, so the plugin also works for PHP versions older than 5.3.
